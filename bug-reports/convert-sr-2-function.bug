convert expression to function

Hola,

is there a way to convert symbolic expression to proper functions?

E. g. `s = sin(x)` into `x |--> sin(x)`

So far I've been using f(x) = s(x), however, deprection warnings occur:

`DeprecationWarning: Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed
arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you
can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)`
